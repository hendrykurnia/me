    <section class="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I have 6+ years of experience in systems integration, automation, and business systems engineering, specializing in building reliable, scalable workflows across revenue and billing ecosystems. At Couchbase, I led major integration initiatives connecting Salesforce, NetSuite, Stripe, Clazar.io, Tackle.io, AWS, and internal platforms using SnapLogic, Workato, and Databricks.</p>
        <p>My work includes modernizing Cloud Marketplace metering pipelines, improving billing accuracy, designing end-to-end website onboarding and payment flows, and migrating manual reconciliation processes into automated Databricks-based data pipelines. I also maintain SOX-compliant documentation and provide ongoing support to resolve issues across critical business systems.</p>
        <p>I began my career in Salesforce administration and Sales Operations, improving CRM data quality, automation, and reporting. Over time, I grew into an integrations-focused role where I architect workflows, build API-based data flows, improve system reliability, and support the full quote-to-cash and cloud consumption billing lifecycle.</p>
