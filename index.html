        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I have 6+ years of experience in Systems Integration, Automation, and Business Systems Engineering, specializing in building reliable, scalable Quote-to-Cash (QTC) and Cloud Consumption-based Billing workflows.</p>
        <p>At Couchbase, I architected and implemented major integration initiatives, including the migration of over 70 critical SnapLogic pipelines to Workato, and engineered connections across Salesforce, NetSuite, Stripe, Clazar.io, Tackle.io, and AWS.</p>
        <p>My key work involved modernizing Cloud Marketplace metering pipelines to improve billing accuracy, designing end-to-end PLG system and website payment flows, and building an automated CPQ process using Workato AI and OpenAI. I also migrated manual reconciliation to automated Databricks-based data pipelines and maintain SOX-compliant documentation for critical business systems.</p>
        <p>I began my career in Salesforce Administration and Sales Operations, where I significantly improved CRM data quality, automation, and reporting, establishing a foundation that underpins my expertise in the full QTC and cloud consumption-based billing lifecycle.</p>
